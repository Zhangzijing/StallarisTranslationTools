 anomaly.710.desc:0 "To their great surprise, the crew of the §Y[Root.GetName]§! has stumbled upon a small [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] settlement on the surface of [From.GetName]. The colony was founded by a group of brave pioneers who departed [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] long ago in a primitive starship. Until now, their vessel had been assumed lost.\n\nThe colony has not been doing well, and their numbers have steadily declined over the last several generations.

 anomaly.2500.name:0 "Dead Remains,3154"
 anomaly.2500.desc:0 "The dead remains of several large spacefaring life forms have been discovered in decaying orbits around the gas giant [From.GetName]. These non-sentient creatures appear to have been capable of interstellar travel, but there are no recorded sightings of them in explored space. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has suggested that we spend additional resources on a more thorough analysis.,3155"
 anomaly.2501.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has deduced that [From.From.GetName] served as an orbital graveyard, where members of the dead alien species we found came to die. Gravity took care of the rest, slowly pulling the remains into the gas giant over a period of millions of years.\n\nThis ancient cycle seems to have stopped abruptly 15 million years ago when the last creature arrived. We can only speculate as to whether they were hunted to extinction by spacefaring civilizations or met their end through some other calamity.,3156"

 anomaly.2520.desc:0 "What was previously thought to be assorted mountains in the southern hemisphere of [From.GetName] have been identified as the massive skeletal remains of a single colossal alien life form.\n\nThe bones have been dated as 3.4 billion years old, but our scientists have ruled out that [From.GetName] could have supported life on that scale at any point in the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s history. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has prepared a special research project to delve further into this mystery.,3162"
 anomaly.2521.desc:0 "After continued studies of the massive skeletal remains found on [From.From.From.GetName], Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has concluded that the creature served as some kind of organic starship. Much smaller bones from at least three separate species were found within the larger skeleton, and we assume these came from members of the crew.\n\nFor unknown reasons, this organic starship suffered catastrophic damage and crash-landed on [From.From.From.GetName]. While we cannot begin to understand the biological engineering necessary to "grow" a starship like this, the study of these bones alone have substantially advanced our knowledge.,3163"
 anomaly.2522.desc:0 "Our continued studies of the massive skeletal remains on [From.From.From.GetName] have managed to shed some light on how the creature ended up on the [From.From.From.GetPlanetMoon]. There are very faint residual energy readings that indicate some kind of dimensional portal existed briefly towards the rear of the skeleton.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] theorizes that the creature passed through this gateway from another dimension only to quickly perish in the hostile environment of [From.From.From.GetName]. Why it did this and where it came from are questions that may never be answered.,3164"

 colony.1.name:0 "Migrating Forests,3350"
 colony.1.desc:0 "The surface of [Root.GetName] is covered in lush forests, with massive tree analogues rising hundreds of meters into the air. Interestingly, our colonists have found that nearly all of the flora is mobile to various degrees. Forests stretching for miles will slowly migrate to new areas richer in nutrients in a cycle that seems tied to the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s orbit.\n\nUnfortunately, this has seriously hampered our efforts to develop the colony's infrastructure. The migrating trees frequently cut power lines while smashing our buildings and roads into rubble.,3351"
 colony.1.a:0 "We need to find a solution.,3352"
 colony.2.desc:0 "We have learned that the roaming forests on [From.From.GetName] avoid certain regions that are home to colonies of a native pseudo-insect. These insects secrete a pheromone that can be used to steer the wandering trees away from population centers.\n\nFurthermore, the areas where the forests most frequently range have been closed off as nature reserves. Our biologists can learn much by studying this reserve from the neighboring regions.,3353"

 colony.3.desc:0 "A napalm bombing campaign has been effective in decimating the migrating forests on [From.From.GetName]. The massive firestorms have left a smoldering landscape in their wake, in which our ecologists have planted more traditional and significantly less mobile off-world trees. Losses to the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s wildlife have been substantial, but within acceptable limits.,3355"
 colony.4.name:0 "Rise of the Trees,3356"
 colony.4.desc:0 "The migrating forests on [Root.GetName] have resurfaced! We knew isolated pockets of their kind had survived in several remote areas, but they appeared dormant. It seems they used this reprieve to replenish their numbers, and they have begun to systematically attack our settlements.\n\nContrary to what we believed, they clearly possess some form of rudimentary intelligence, and they're out for revenge!,3357"

 colony.8.desc:0 "It would appear the migrating forests we exterminated on [Root.GetName] played a more vital role in the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s ecology than previously thought.

 colony.9.name:0 "Forest Adaptation,3369"
 colony.9.desc:0 "Continued interaction between our colonists and the wandering forests on [Root.GetName] has revealed that the trees are in possession of some form of rudimentary communal intelligence.

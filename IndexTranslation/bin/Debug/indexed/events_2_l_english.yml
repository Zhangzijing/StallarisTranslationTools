They are simply spawned from the host once the host reaches maturity, created as tools rather than the result of procreation.

The obvious drawbacks in this inherently delayed reaction time are somewhat offset by the Amoeba's sheer number of circulating flagella, and the individual flagellum's strong set of reflexive responses and ability to dumbly track the host Amoeba.

 colony.1502.name:0 "远古无人机：苏醒,1865"
 colony.1502.desc:0 "这些无人机从它们的沉眠中苏醒了and descended to the surface of [Root.GetName]. Attempts to communicate were met with polite dismissal as they set about terraforming a small area of the planet.

 colony.1503.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Reaching For Past Skies,1869"
 colony.1503.desc:0 "The old drones fitfully dormant on [Root.GetName]'s moon have become active again, and their work is a mixed blessing.\n\nUnder the cover of night and spotty airspace surveillance, they have erected the framework of some gigantic structure a short distance away from our primary settlement on [Root.GetName]. Our engineers are convinced it is the realization of some outmoded concept known as a "space elevator", perhaps a common sight in the times before we [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] first took to the stars. It will eventually have to be razed as it stands in the way of our expansion plans for the colony, and bringing it down safely will take some time. At least our engineers are giddy with excitement at the prospect of studying the thing up close.,1870"

 colony.1504.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Spontaneous Generosity,1872"
 colony.1504.desc:0 "After waking yet again, the drones briefly disappeared from sensors. When they returned, it was with a large cache of minerals of unknown origin in tow. They dumped it on the surface of [Root.GetName] after sending a badly corrupted burst transmission indicating that they had fulfilled a requisition request.\n\nThen they went back to the moon.,1873"
 colony.1504.a:0 "Free minerals. No complaints.,1874"
 colony.1505.name:0 "Ancient Drones: An Estranged Relative,1875"
 colony.1505.desc:0 "Frantic signal bursts from the moon alerted us to the fact that the old drones on [Root.GetPlanetMoon] have woken yet again. This time they bring us a significant prize, as they have unearthed an ancient satellite from the depths of their moon and partially repaired it. We do not know how the satellite ended up there, nor why the drones have ignored it until now. Regardless, if even a fragment of its databanks have survived, there is a lot we can learn about day-to-day life in the empires that the drones first served.,1876"
 colony.1506.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Drone Debacle,1877"
 colony.1506.desc:0 "The erratic behavior of the narcoleptic drones have taken a violent turn. A number of them woke and entered the atmosphere of [Root.GetName], as is their wont, only to slam into the surface of the planet at full thrust.\n\nRepeatedly, in many cases.\n\nDamage to the colony was negligible but the nigh-invulnerable drones were destroyed in bright showers of blue sparks, indicative of the tremendous force of, and dedication to, their self-destruction.,1878"
 colony.1506.a:0 "Can we find out what was wrong with them?,1879"
 colony.1507.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Looking For Drones,1880"
 colony.1507.desc:0 "The surviving drones have been missing since the suicide incident. History buffs on [Root.GetName] are convinced the drones are still in close proximity, shielded from prying eyes by some lost technology, but the expected time window for their next activation has come and gone.\n\nProgress on deep analysis of the destroyed drones' remains has been slow, but a breakthrough is expected soon.,1881"
 colony.1507.a:0 "Keep me posted.,1882"
 colony.1508.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Panning For Gold,1883"
 colony.1508.desc:0 "Sorting out the errant innards of the shattered drones took much longer than anticipated, as each drone seems to have been built from a slightly different design, assembled from slightly different parts. Once this fact was established, one thing stood out - the parts that were identical. Separated from the rest, it is clear these parts are of somewhat modern, if alien, make. It is likely that someone has done what we could not, and tampered with the drones.,1884"
 colony.1508.a:0 "This warrants further investigation.,1885"
 colony.1509.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Alien to the Aliens,1886"
 colony.1509.desc:0 "Having pieced them together, the foreign objects inside the destroyed drones have been identified by our experts as one-way transmitters. Since they are not set to receive, it is safe to assume that the drones were not acting at the behest of some third party. Rather, some entity has been keeping tabs on the drones' activities. It is advisable to look into this matter, so a special project has been prepared.,1887"
 colony.1510.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Schemes Revealed,1888"
 colony.1510.desc:0 "We have found the remaining drones, drifting into orbit around [Root.GetPlanetMoon]. We have learned that they are unwitting pawns in an elaborate scheme set up by an unknown faction.\n\nGoing by the modus operandi of this operation, this faction is most likely a particularly old and particularly clever pirate syndicate. They must have found the drones drifting through space and done what we could not; modified them. While not as impressive as it sounds - all they did was introduce self-contained alien technology into the drones - fact remains that these alien pirates possess a technological know-how far in advance of our own, at least in certain areas. Having installed their comms devices in the drones, the pirates let them drift through space again, knowing that they are set to assist their original masters' colonists and that the drones' ability to accurately identify such colonists has degraded with age. The drones have essentially been fattening up our colony as the pirates watch, waiting for the ideal time to strike.\n\nOur military analysts predict that the pirates will strike within the next two years.,1889"

Reprogramming them proved to be a relatively easy task now that we know how to break them open, and we have plotted a course for the estimated location of the pirate fleet.

 colony.1521.desc:0 "Long-term exposure to the pollen naturally occurring in [Root.GetName]'s atmosphere acts on the colonists' pheromone receptors with a mild aphrodisiac effect, accompanied by a barely-perceptible "high". The plant that produces the most potent strain is a flower common to all areas of the planet; squirreled away into some obscure taxonomic nook by scientists on [Root.GetName] but known in the local [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] dialect as "Mharin Kharin".,1907"

 colony.1522.desc:0 "Reports from [Root.GetName] indicate that worker productivity has declined recently, becoming stable at levels several percent lower than the [Root.Owner.GetName] average.\n\nThis may or may not be due to the stimulating effects of the pollen native to the planet.\n\nIt probably is.\n\nA special project has been prepared should we wish to make our production pipelines more efficient to make up for the loss.,1911"

 colony.1523.desc:0 "Far-reaching changes to time management paradigms and the way responsibility is delegated within all fields of production and other duties on [Root.GetName] have produced good results. The populace has an evident desire - outside observers would call it an outright need - to be in close proximity to the native flora.\n\nWith clever scheduling and additional checks in place, productivity remains low but has risen above the lower limit of what can be deemed acceptable.,1914"
 colony.1523.a:0 "Good work.,1915"
 colony.1524.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Rooted in Place,1916"
 colony.1524.desc:0 "A recent survey indicates that residents of [Root.GetName] are much less likely than other denizens of the [Root.Owner.GetName] to migrate to other planets.\n\nThe survey does not address whether this could be due to a psychological dependency on the low-level sensory arousal caused by Mharin Kharin and its sibling-plants.,1917"
 colony.1525.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Transmission Trouble,1918"
 colony.1525.desc:0 "While productivity is no longer declining on the planet, communications between the colony on [Root.GetName] and the capital on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] are breaking down. Senior officials on [Root.GetName] are growing increasingly distant, and our clerks are complaining that even relaying simple directives is becoming an exercise in frustration.,1919"

Fortunately for us, their plot to do as little work as possible was, unsurprisingly, sloppily executed and easily discovered. Heads will roll - metaphorically speaking of course - as our last recourse is to depose the local government and manage the colony's affairs from the capital.,1923"
 colony.1526.a:0 "It won't be pretty.,1924"
 colony.1527.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: With an Iron Fist, From Afar,1925"
 colony.1527.desc:0 "Our remote-government of [Root.GetName] is now firmly established. It has met with some success in suppressing the proliferation of the pollen-bearing plant Mharin Kharin as well as in eroding the community's acceptance of "using" it - no small feat considering the act is as innocent as smelling a flower.,1926"
 colony.1528.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Slash and Burn,1927"
 colony.1528.desc:0 "Our remote-governance of [Root.GetName] continues to be a somewhat awkward but effective arrangement. The council in charge has allegedly secured the loyalty of a faction of our armed forces on the planet - apparently they prefer staying indoors to breathing in the Mharin Kharin pollen. The remote-government wishes to use these troops to mount an offensive on the flower, having them erect atmospheric purifiers and wiping the plant from all urban areas entirely.,1928"
 colony.1528.a:0 "We should have done this a long time ago.,1929"
 colony.1528.a.tooltip:0 "The intoxicating plant is strictly controlled and contained outside of populated areas, removing all related modifiers.\n,1930"
 colony.1529.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Pollen Worship,1931"
 colony.1529.desc:0 "Fringe elements on [Root.GetName] have banded together to form a quasi-religious organization seeking to control all aspects of the Mharin Kharin flower and its cultivation. Their leader, a self-styled "Green Hierophant" of this "Flower Temple" claims to speak for all flora and fauna of [Root.GetName] and demands exclusive trading rights for the plant.\n\nThis is of course completely unacceptable and impossible, as the native flora of [Root.GetName] is of little strategic or economic value and thus may not be brought off-world by law.\n\nUnfortunately, they are unlikely to accept this fact gracefully.,1932"
 colony.1530.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Beginning of Pollen's End,1933"
 colony.1530.desc:0 "The Flower Temple and its followers now make up a sizable minority of the population on [Root.GetName], and reports indicate a disturbing change in the movement. Their futile attempts to smuggle Mharin Kharin specimen off-world have been growing less enthusiastic by the day, as the Flower Temple seems to be transitioning into a doomsday cult. There is likely a correlation with the recent changes in the Mharin Kharin pollen's chemical makeup, detected by atmospheric sensors.\n\nA special project has been prepared to assess the risks associated with this, and it is recommended to complete it before something goes horribly wrong.,1934"
 colony.1530.a:0 "Very well.,1935"
 colony.1531.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Disaster Averted,1936"
 colony.1531.desc:0 "Quick and decisive action allowed us to identify the risks associated with the rapid changes in the pollen native to [Root.GetName] and take the necessary steps.\n\nThe necessary steps were a complete planetary evacuation and a planet-wide tactical pesticide bombing run, targeting the Mharin Kharin flower and its ilk.\n\nThe plants were rapidly mutating and their unique pollen would, had they not been destroyed, soon have begun delivering a potent neurotoxin to the olfactory organs of all sentient life on [Root.GetName].\n\nThe scientists on the colonization council theorize that this is part of a natural cycle on [Root.GetName] and that the pollen's adverse effects on us, in the form of a crumbling local administration, the rise of the Flower Temple cult, and eventual pollen toxicity, were chance side-effects rather than the product of a plant's sinister self-defense mechanism.\n\nRegardless, any and all traces of the flower have been wiped from the planet's surface, and our colonists are safe and free of the pollen's influence.,1937"

 colony.1532.desc:0 "Something went horribly wrong.\n\nVast swaths of Mharin Kharin flowers spontaneously mutated in unison, spreading like wildfire and turning their pollen poisonous, and we were too late.\n\nBoth our evacuation efforts and our attempts to neutralize the pollen fell short of the mark and the inhabitants of [Root.GetName] paid the price.\n\nThe plant life of [Root.GetName] achieved only a pyrrhic victory, though this fact is scant consolation. The whole genus that Mharin Kharin belonged to burned in the fire of its own unnaturally rapid proliferation. The soil is starved of the specific nutrients the pollinating plants need - once the currently living specimens die, which will be soon, it will be a long time before that flora can again establish a foothold in the ecosystem, if it ever will.\n\nThe inhabitants of [Root.GetName] are dead, and the planet's atmosphere is temporarily noxious with plant emissions.,1941"

 colony.1533.desc:0 "A planetary surveillance team reports that the toxic miasma that enveloped a planet two years ago and led to the destruction of our colony has lifted. The planet is different now, changed into a desert world after the violent blooming of Mharin Kharin and the atmosphere becoming saturated with pollen.\n\nIt will take more than these two years for the [Root.Owner.GetName] to forget the tragic fate of those who lived there, but the planet itself is no longer actively hostile to sentient life.,1944"

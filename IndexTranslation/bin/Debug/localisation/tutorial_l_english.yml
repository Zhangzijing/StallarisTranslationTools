 tutorial.3.name:0 "Tutorial: Technologies"
 tutorial.3.desc:2 "Researching new technologies will be critical to our success. I tell you this not merely as a product of unfettered technological progress, but as your trusted advisor and, I suspect, your only true friend.\n\nOne important technology that we should research as soon as possible is §SNew Worlds Protocol§!. It will give us access to §SColony Ships§! which will allow us to establish footholds on other planets."
 tutorial.6.name:0 "Technologies Researched"
 tutorial.6.desc:1 "Excellent work! The technology we just finished researching will certainly benefit us. Don't forget to give our scientists new research assignments."
 tutorial.7.name:0 "Tutorial: Construction Ship"
 tutorial.7.desc:0 "The resources generated by our homeworld will only take us so far. Our industry needs to expand off-world, and that requires a §SConstruction Ship§!.\n\nWe should build one as soon as we have amassed enough §SMinerals§! to do so."
 tutorial.8.name:0 "Construction Ship Built"
 tutorial.8.desc:0 "Good job! Our §SConstruction Ship§! is now up and running, and its hardy crew includes some of the finest engineers available to our nation."
 tutorial.9.name:0 "Tutorial: Mining Station"
 tutorial.9.desc:1 "The resources generated by our homeworld will only take us so far. Luckily our §SScience Ship§! has just found a resource deposit on another world! The time has come to use our §SConstruction Ship§! to build a §SMining Station§!.\n\nMining Stations can be built within our borders and automatically collect §SMinerals§! and any §SStrategic Resources§! found on the bodies they orbit. Keep in mind that they have an £energy  §SEnergy Credit§! maintenance cost."
 tutorial.10.name:0 "Mining Station Built"
 tutorial.10.desc:0 "Very good. The new §SMining Station§! is operational, and it has already begun gathering resources for processing."
 tutorial.11.name:0 "Tutorial: Research Station"
 tutorial.11.desc:0 "Surveyed worlds sometimes possess unique properties that make them valuable objects of research. These £physics  §SPhysics§!, £society  §SSociety§! or £engineering  §SEngineering§! resources can be collected by a §SResearch Station§!. My programming strongly compels me to compel you to build one.\n\nKeep in mind that §SResearch Stations§! can only be built within our borders, and have a maintenance cost in £energy  §SEnergy Credits§!."

Tiles can generate resources, but we will need §SPlanetary Buildings§! to get the most out of them.\n\nOur homeworld already has a few buildings, including our capital, but the time has come to add more. §SPops§! who are not working a resource or staffing a §SBuilding§! on a §STile§! are considered to be §SUnemployed§!."
 tutorial.14.name:0 "Building Constructed"
 tutorial.14.desc:0 "Excellent. Construction has been finished on our new §SPlanetary Building§!, and it should now begin producing resources.\n\nDon't forget to make certain that the building is staffed by a Pop."
 tutorial.15.name:0 "Tutorial: Tile Blockers"
 tutorial.15.desc:0 "§SSurface Tiles§! on habitable planets are sometimes blocked, preventing their use. Clearing a £blocker  §STile Blocker§! takes time and costs £minerals  §SMinerals§! and £energy  §SEnergy Credits§!, but the free space often makes it worthwhile.\n\nMany tile blockers require specific technologies before they can be removed, but the ones on our homeworld can be dealt with as soon as we have the credits to spare."

 tutorial.22.desc:0 "We have a brand new §SScience Ship§!, but no §SScientist§! has been assigned to command it. My programming insists that I should point out the benefits of adding an organic §SScientist§! component to the mix.\n\nIf we cannot afford to recruit a new §SScientist§! we can always reassign one from another department, even though it is hardly ideal."
 tutorial.23.name:0 "Scientist Recruited"
